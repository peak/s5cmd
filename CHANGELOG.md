## not released yet

#### Breaking changes
#### Features
#### Improvements
#### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug introduced with `external sort` support in `sync` command which prevents `sync` to an empty destination with `--delete` option. ([#576](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/576))

## v2.1.0 - 19 Jun 2023

#### Breaking changes
- Adjacent slashes in key are no longer removed when uploading to remote. Before `s5cmd cp file.txt s3://bucket/a//b///c/` would copy to `s3://bucket/a/b/c/file.txt` but now to `s3://bucket/a//b///c/file.txt`.([#459](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/459))
- `--endpoint-url` will not accept URLs without scheme such as `example.com`. Instead, it will give an error and ask for an url with a scheme; either `http://example.com` or `https://example.com` ([#496](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/496)).

#### Features
- Added `--content-type` and `--content-encoding` flags to `cp` command. ([#264](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/264))
- Added `--profile` flag to allow users to specify a [named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html). ([#353](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/353))
- Added `--credentials-file` flag to allow users to specify path for the AWS credentials file instead of using the [default location](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where).
- Added `--all-versions` flag to `ls`, `rm`, `du` and `select` subcommands to apply operation on(/over) all versions of the objects. ([#475](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/475))
- Added `--version-id` flag to `cat`, `cp`/`mv`, `rm`, `du`  and `select` subcommands to apply operation on(/over) a specific versions of the object. ([#475](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/475))
- Added `bucket-version` command to configure bucket versioning. Bucket name alone returns the bucket versioning status of the bucket. Bucket versioning can be configured with `set` flag. ([#475](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/475)) 
- Added `--raw` flag to `cat` and `select` subcommands. It disables the wildcard operations. ([#475](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/475)) 
- Added `bench.py` script under new `benchmark` folder to compare performances of two different builds of s5cmd. ([#471](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/471))

#### Improvements
- Disable AWS SDK logger if log level is not `trace`. ([#460](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/460))
- Allow adjacent slashes to be used as keys when uploading to remote. ([#459](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/459))
- Debian packages are provided on [releases page](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/releases) ([#380](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/380))
- Upgraded minimum required Go version to 1.17.
- The sync command uses `external sort` instead of `internal` sort. This change
 reduces RAM usage from ~10 GB to ~1.5 GB for `sync` operation of a directory containing
 1,000,000 files at a cost of speed (20% slower for 1,000,000 objects). For smaller
 directories (~50,000 files) there is no significant change in speed.  ([#483](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/483))

- Improve auto-completion support of s5cmd for `zsh` and `bash`, start supporting `pwsh` and stop the support for `fish`. Now s5cmd can complete bucket names, s3 keys in a bucket and the local files. However, `install-completion` flag no longer _installs_ the completion script to `*rc` files instead it merely gives instructions to install autocompletion and provides the autocompletion script ([#500](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/500)).

#### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where (`--stat`) prints unnecessarily when used with help and version commands ([#452](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/452))
- Changed cp error message to be more precise. "given object not found" error message now will also include absolute path of the file. ([#463](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/463))
- Fixed a bug where some part of the destination path is removed by `cp` and `sync` subcommands ([#360](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/360))
- Fixed a bug where proxy is not being used when `--no-verify-ssl` flag is used. ([#445](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/445))
- Fixed `unknown url format` error when object key also includes `s3://` e.g. `s5cmd ls s3://foo/bar/s3://baz` ([#449](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/449))
- Fixed a bug where the local file created for the download operation was not deleted if the download fails in Windows. ([#348](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/348))

## v2.0.0 - 4 Jul 2022

#### Breaking changes
- Dropped inline comment feature for `run` command. Previously s5cmd supported a command with an inline comment like `ls s3://bucket/object.gz  # inline comment`. ([#309](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/309))
- Changed homebrew installation command on macOS. Users can install s5cmd via `brew install peak/tap/s5cmd`. ([#356](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/356))
- Print usage errors to stderr instead of stdout and do not show help text on usage error. ([#399](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/399))
- Working directory of the Docker image changed to `/aws` from `/`. ([#412](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/412))

#### Features
- Added `sync` command to synchronize two given buckets, prefixes, or objects. ([#3](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/3))
- Added AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) profiles support. ([#385](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/385))
- Added `--force-glacier-transfer` flag to `select` command. ([#346](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/346))
- Added `--ignore-glacier-warnings` flag to `cp`, `mv` and `select` commands. ([#346](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/346))
- Added `--request-payer` flag to include `x-amz-request-payer` in header while sending GET, POST and HEAD requests. ([#297](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/297)) [@Kirill888](https://github.com/Kirill888)
- Added `--use-list-objects-v1` flag to force using S3 ListObjects API instead of ListObjectsV2 API. ([#405](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/405)) [@greenpau](https://github.com/greenpau)
- Added trace log level(`--log=trace`) which enables SDK debug logs.([#363](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/363))

#### Improvements
- Upgraded minimum required Go version to 1.16.

#### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug about precedence of region detection, which auto region detection would always override region defined in environment or profile. ([#325](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/325))
- Fixed a bug where errors did not result a non-zero exit code. ([#304](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/304))
- Print error if the commands file of `run` command is not accessible. ([#410](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/410))
- Updated region detection call to use current session's address resolving method ([#314](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/314))
- Fixed a bug where lines with large tokens fail in `run` command. `sync` was failing when it finds multiple files to remove. ([#435](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/435), [#436](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/436))
- Print usage error if given log level(`--log`) is not valid. ([#430](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/430))
- Fixed a bug where (`--stat`) is ignored when log level is error. ([#359](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/359))

## v1.4.0 - 21 Sep 2021

## v1.2.0 - 5 Nov 2020

With this release, `s5cmd` automatically determines region information of destination buckets.

#### Features

- Added global `--dry-run` option. It displays which command(s) will be executed without actually having a side effect. ([#90](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/90))
- Added `--stat` option for `s5cmd` and it displays program execution statistics before the end of the program output. ([#148](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/148))
- Added cross-region transfer support. Bucket regions are inferred, thus, supporting cross-region transfers and multiple regions in batch mode. ([#155](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/155))

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed incorrect MIME type inference for `cp`, give priority to file extension for type inference. ([#214](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/214))
- Fixed error reporting issue, where some errors from the `ls` operation were not printed.

#### Improvements

- Requests to different buckets not allowed in `rm` batch operation, i.e., throw an error.
- AWS S3 `RequestTimeTooSkewed` request error was not retryable before, it is now. ([205](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/205))
- For some operations errors were printed at the end of the program execution. Now, errors are displayed immediately after being detected. ([#136](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/136))
- From now on, docker images will be published on Docker Hub. ([#238](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/238))
- Changed misleading 'mirroring' examples in the help text of `cp`. ([#213](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/213))


## v1.1.0 - 22 Jul 2020

With this release, Windows is supported.

#### Breaking changes

- Dropped storage class short codes display from default behaviour of `ls` operation. Instead, use `-s` flag with `ls`
to see full names of the storage classes when listing objects.


#### Features

- Added Server-side Encryption (SSE) support for mv/cp operations. It uses customer master keys (CMKs) managed by AWS Key Management Service. ([#18](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/18))
- Added an option to show full form of [storage class](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/) when listing objects. ([#165](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/165))
- Add [access control lists (ACLs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html)
support to enable managing access to buckets and objects. ([#26](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/26))


#### Bugfixes

- Fixed infinite repetition issue on mv/cp operations which would occur
 if the destination matched the source wildcard. ([#168](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/168))
- Fixed windows filepath issue, where backslashes should be treated as the path delimiter. ([#178](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/178))
- All tests pass on windows, by converting and treating file paths to UNIX filepath format.
- Fixed a transfer issue where the object path contains particular regex metacharacters. ([#111](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/111)) [@brendan-matroid](https://github.com/brendan-matroid)
- Correctly parse object paths that contain whitespaces in run-mode. ([#111](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/111)) [@brendan-matroid](https://github.com/brendan-matroid)


#### Improvements

- Retry when connection closed by S3 unexpectedly. ([#189](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/189)) [@eminugurkenar](https://github.com/eminugurkenar)

## v1.0.0 - 1 Apr 2020

This is a major release with many breaking changes.

#### Breaking changes

- Dropped `get` command. Users could get the same effect with `s5cmd cp <src> .`.
- Dropped `nested command` support.
- Dropped `!` command. It was used to execute shell commands and was used in
  conjunction with nested commands.
- `s5cmd -f` and `s5cmd -f -` usage has changed to `s5cmd run`. `run` command
  accepts a file. If not provided, it'll listen for commands from stdin.
- Exit code for errors was `127`. It is `1` now.
- Dropped `exit` command. It was used to change the shell exit code and usually
  a part of the nested command usage.
- Dropped local->local copy and move support. ([#118](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/118))
- All error messages are sent to stderr now.
- `-version` flag is changed to `version` command.
- Dropped `batch-rm` command. It was not listed in the help output. Now that we
  support variadic arguments, users can remove multiple objects by providing
  wildcards or multiple arguments to `s5cmd rm` command. ([#106](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/106))
- [Virtual host style bucket name
  resolving](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/)
  is enabled by default for S3 and GCS. If you provide a custom endpoint via
  `--endpoint-url` flag (other than GCS and S3 transfer acceleration), `s5cmd`
  will fall back to the `path-style`. ([#92](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/92))
- Listing a non-existent object will return exit code `1`, instead of `0`. ([#23](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/23))
- `-ds`, `-dw`, `-us` and `-uw` global flags are no longer available. Multipart
  concurrency and part size flags are now part of the `cp/mv` command. New
  replacement flags are `--concurrency | -c` and `--part-size | -p`. ([#110](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/110))
- s5cmd `cp` command follows symbolic links by default (only when uploading to
  s3 from local filesystem). Use `--no-follow-symlinks` flag to disable this
  feature. ([#17](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/17))
- Dropped `-parents` flag from copy command. Copy behaviour has changed to
  preserve the directory hierarchy as a default. Optional `-flatten` flag is
  added to flatten directory structure. ([#107](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/107))
- Dropped `-vv` verbosity flag. `--log` flag is introduced.

#### Features

- Added `mb` command to make buckets. ([#25](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/25))
- Added `--json` flag for JSON logging. ([#22](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/22))
- Added [S3 transfer acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html) support. ([#40](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/40))
- Added [Google Cloud Storage](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd#google-cloud-storage-support) support. ([#81](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/81))
- Added `cat` command to print remote object contents to stdout ([#20](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/20))

#### Bugfixes

- Correctly set `Content-Type` of a file on upload operations. ([#33](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/33))
- Fixed a bug where workers are unable to consume job if there are too many
  outstanding wildcard expansion requests. ([#12](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/12), [#58](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/58))

#### Improvements

- Pre-compiled binaries are provided on [releases page](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/releases) ([#21](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/21))
- AWS Go SDK is updated to support IAM role for service accounts. ([#32](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/32))
- For copy/move operations, `s5cmd` now creates destination directory if missing.
- Increase the soft limit of open files to 1000 and exits immediately when it encounters `too many open files` error. ([#52](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/52))
