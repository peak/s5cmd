# Changelog

## not released yet

This is a major release with many breaking changes.

#### Breaking changes

- Dropped `get` command. Users could get the same effect with `s5cmd cp <src> .`.
- Dropped `nested command` support.
- Dropped `!` command. It was used to execute shell commands and was used in
  conjunction with nested commands.
- `s5cmd -f` and `s5cmd -f -` usage has changed to `s5cmd run`. `run` command
  accepts a file. If not provided, it'll listen for commands from stdin.
- Exit code for errors was `127`. It is `1` now.
- Dropped `exit` command. It was used to change the shell exit code and usually
  a part of the nested command usage.
- Dropped local->local copy and move support. ([#118](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/118))
- All error messages are sent to stderr now.
- `-version` flag is changed to `version` command.
- Dropped `batch-rm` command. It was not listed in the help output. Now that we
  support variadic arguments, users can remove multiple objects by providing
  wildcards or multiple arguments to `s5cmd rm` command. ([#106](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/106))
- [Virtual host style bucket name
  resolving](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/)
  is enabled by default for S3 and GCS. If you provide a custom endpoint via
  `--endpoint-url` flag (other than GCS and S3 transfer acceleration), `s5cmd`
  will fall back to the `path-style`. ([#92](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/92))
- Listing a non-existent object will return exit code `1`, instead of `0`. ([#23](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/23))
- `-ds`, `-dw`, `-us` and `-uw` global flags are no longer available. Multipart
  concurrency and part size flags are now part of the `cp/mv` command. New
  replacement flags are `--concurrency | -c` and `--part-size | -p`. ([#110](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/pull/110))

#### Features

- Added `mb` command to make buckets. ([#25](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/25))
- Added `--json` flag for JSON logging. ([#22](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/22))
- Added [S3 transfer acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html) support. ([#40](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/40))
- Added [Google Cloud Storage](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd#google-cloud-storage-support) support. ([#81](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/81))

#### Bugfixes

- Correctly set `Content-Type` of a file on upload operations. ([#33](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/33))

#### Improvements

- Pre-compiled binaries are provided on [releases page](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/releases). ([#21](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/21))
- AWS Go SDK is updated to support IAM role for service accounts. ([#32](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/issues/32))
- For copy/move operations, `s5cmd` now creates destination directory if missing.
